Question 0: Why is this error being thrown?

This error is thrown because the Pokemon model has not been defined yet.



Question 1: How are the random Pokemon appearing? What is the common factor between all the possible Pokemon that appear?





Question 2a: What does the following line in the help text do? Be specific about what "capture_path(id: @pokemon)" is doing. If you're having trouble, look at the Help section in the README. *
<%= button_to "Throw a Pokeball!", capture_path(id: @pokemon), :class => "button medium", :method => :patch %>





Question 2b: Change the URI pattern of the capture_path from "capture" to "asdf" in your routes.rb. Try capturing another Pokemon. Why does the route still work? *
Remember, the URI pattern is the string following the request type in the route. For instance for a route "GET 'pokemons'", the URI pattern is 'pokemons'.




Question 3: What would you name your own Pokemon? *



Question 4: What did you pass into the redirect_to? If it is a path, what did that path need? If it is not a path, why is it okay not to have a path here? *





Question 5: Explain how putting this line "flash[:error] = @pokemon.errors.full_messages.to_sentence" shows error messages on your form. *
Hint: Take a look at views/layouts/application.html.erb. What does this file do, and what is it rendering? If you need to learn more about application.html.erb, Google is your friend!
